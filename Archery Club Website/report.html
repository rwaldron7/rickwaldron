            <h4>Main focuses</h4>
            <p> This website is for a archery club, and I had three main focuses when design the website:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the website visually appealing</li>
                <li>Make the website easy to navigate</li>
                <li>Contain all necessary information in logically separated pages</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The first focus was achieved through the use of a header of a different colour and by choosing a different font to the default. The second focus was achieved through a simple menu in the header that changes to a mobile friendly menu for smaller screens. The last focus was achieved through separating the content into 7 separate pages with a different topic presented in each.</p>
            <h4>Accessibility</h4>
            <p>The design conforms to W3C design suggestions for assecibility. In particular, this website is mobile friendly and contains colour contrast that is easy to read on a screen. Contextual information is provided at all points, and the design is one that should feel familiar to users of the internet.</p>
            <h4>Design standards</h4>
            <p>Further design standards that have been considered include having the name and logo on each page, with the logo linking to the home page on all pages except for the home page itself. Search was deemed necessary for a small site such as this, and clear headings and subheadings were used to make finding information an efficient and effortless process.</p>
            <p>Other features were incorporated such as link titles when the link in question wasn't self-evident and the club name changing to an acronym for smaller screens to avoid having the header take up too much space.</p>
            </p>
            <h4>Extra features</h4>
            <p>To help engage a potential new club member, an image slideshow was added to the bottom of each page. This allows the user to click through club photos at their own pace, and this helps add colour to the lower part of each page. The overall effect is the main website content being bordered top and bottom by colour, which adds vertical symmetry.</p>
            <p>For mobile users, the navigation links collapse and the user sees a hamburger menu. This is the universal symbol for menu, and when the user clicks on this they will see the navigation links down the right 50% of the page. This blocks the text, however when the user clicks a link or reclicks the menu button this will dissapear.</p>
